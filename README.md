# CPSC210 Personal Project Proposal

## By Kent Chen

For the term project, I am planning to design a chess game application. 
The game will include all chess figures, and each side will have:
- 1 *King*
- 1 *Queen*
- 2 *Bishops*
- 2 *Knights*
- 2 *Rooks*
- 8 *Pawns*

This application has limited functions: 
- it **CAN** be used by players who want to play against themselves,
- it **CAN** be used by players who want to play against others (on the same device),
- but it **CANNOT** be used by players who want to play against robots,
- and it **CANNOT** be used by players who want to play one game using more than one device.

This project is of interest to me because chess is one of the board games that I favour
and that I am familiar with. The chess figures have complicated rules regarding movements (e.g., king-rook switch), which
brings numerous challenges to the designing process. Nevertheless, I believe that the overall experience will be
fun and rewarding.
